            <p class="left">My name is Mia Liang, and I was born in New Jersey, USA, in a Chinese household. Growing up with Chinese culture at home and American culture at school has profoundly influenced my work and identity. When I was eight, my family moved to Abu Dhabi, UAE, due to a shift in my father's job. The diversity and new culture of Abu Dhabi changed my perspective, as I learned to appreciate the importance of representation and cultural competency. Since then, I‚Äôve embraced my identity as a Chinese-American living in the UAE, and much of my work reflects this journey.</p>

            <p class="right">Growing up as a third-culture kid at an international school has shaped my ability to connect with people from diverse backgrounds, fostering an open-minded and adaptable approach to communication and teamwork. This experience has enhanced my flexibility and cultural awareness, allowing me to thrive in collaborative environments. Over the years, I‚Äôve gained extensive experience creating posters, films, and art projects, as well as planning events for causes and clubs I‚Äôm passionate about, including film festivals and community initiatives. As a leader in multiple clubs, I‚Äôve managed a variety of tasks, from organizing meetings to curating Instagram content and liaising with teachers and administrators.</p>

            <p class="left">From a young age, I‚Äôve always enjoyed the arts. I started dancing at four, took art lessons at five, and began playing the piano at six. My lifelong passion for the arts has led me to explore a wide range of creative disciplines, including film, photography, mixed media, graphic design, and theatre. Through these experiences, I‚Äôve developed skills in cinematography, editing, and design. My interest in both creativity and technology has also driven me to master tools such as 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, and software like Fusion 360 and Blender. I‚Äôve designed objects for 3D printing and honed my proficiency in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and Premiere Pro. Inspired by my love for media, I‚Äôve created and acted in numerous short films, further refining my technical, performance, and creative skills.</p>

            <p class="right">For me, art provides purpose and serves as an outlet for my emotions and ideas. As someone who struggles to verbalize my thoughts, I find that film, drawing, performing, and creating allow me to express myself with strength and confidence. Emotion is a key focus in my art. I love creating pieces rooted in personal experiences that provoke strong feelings; this is what I believe makes art meaningful. I often start with a specific emotion I want to convey and work to communicate that to the audience, who probably have experienced similar feelings.</p>

            <p class="left">I dedicate time to creating art not only to produce something I‚Äôm proud of, but also to craft works that others find valuable, inspiring, and stimulating. I‚Äôm particularly drawn to collages, mixed media, doodles, and pieces that seamlessly blend multiple mediums into one cohesive work, as this allows me to combine my creative skills to produce meaningful interactive pieces. For me, interactions are what make life meaningful because they involve active engagement and mutual exchange. It pushes us to become active participants rather than passive consumers. I believe interactivity is crucial for storytelling and society as a whole because it connects us with each other and with technology. It can make people feel valued, create unique and impactful art, and build community in ways nothing else can. This is why I‚Äôve become more interested in producing immersive experiences involving interactivity, such as concerts or theatre performances. I would also love to create visuals for live events.</p>

            <p class="right">Last year, I made a film about my mom that moved several classmates to tears. A few years ago, I created a film reflecting my childhood struggles with my Chinese identity and culture. After the screening, someone told me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy you are using a platform to create change and share your experiences.‚Äù This feedback thrilled me, as it showed that something so personal and cathartic for me could have a positive and powerful impact on others.</p>

            <article> 
            <p class="left">Five years from now, I hope to be working in the film or live performance industry, creating visuals or producing films and events that I am passionate about. I‚Äôm also interested in creative marketing, as I see marketing as both an art and a tool to help others and make things more accessible. Creative marketing and producing would allow me to combine my creative and analytical skills, along with my interests in business and entertainment. I would love to work with the marketing team for concerts, music festivals, and films. Ten years from now, I hope to establish a multidisciplinary interactive media company where artists from different disciplines and around the world can collaborate and share their work, gaining exposure for their talents and impactful art. At the same time, I would love to be creating my own projects as well. I strive to make a positive impact on those around me and in the world by combining art, marketing, and technology.</p>
